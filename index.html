		<p>Hello, I am Dekriel.</p>
		<p>apologies for the blandness of this website, I was not bothered to implement bootstrap.</p>
		<p>I just did this for fun, this isn't like some kind of personal website of some sort.</p>
		<p>this is a website hosted on GitHub pages.</p>
		<p>if you want a website then do the following:</p>
		<li>sign up to GitHub if you haven't already.</li>
		<li>search up GitHub pages.</li>
		<li>follow steps.</li>
		<p>cool now you're done</p>
